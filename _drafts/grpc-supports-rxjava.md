## gRPC
The best description of gRPC can be seen at wikipedia.
>gRPC is an open source remote procedure call (RPC) system
initially developed at Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport,
Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, 
and provides features such as authentication, bidirectional 
streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, 
and cancellation and timeouts. It generates cross-platform 
client and server bindings for many languages.
